# Portfolio Optimization
Hybrid meta-heuristics for constrained portfolio selection problem

Overview

In this project I used a metaheuristic algorithm that is the particle swarm optimization as
a master solver to generate possible solutions from the search space which were further
transferred to a quadratic problem solver to find an optimal solution for portfolio
optimization. Further, we added constraints which are analogous to decisions faced in the
real world.
